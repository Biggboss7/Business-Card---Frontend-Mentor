## Overview

### The Challenge

This is the challenge from Frontend Mentor to build a Business preview
card by using HTML & CSS. Our Challenge is to build the preview card
and get it looking as close to the design as possible. Besides, it should
be able to responsive (adapt to different size of device screen).
